	   VAMIX Setup

==================================

Please follow these instructions to get VAMIX working

1. Extract vamixfiles.zip to you preferred destination
2. Keep the file-folder hierarchy as it is otherwise VAMIX will not work
3. After extraction the hierarchy should look as such:

	vamixfiles----->libs (folder)----->all external .jar files
		    |
		    |
		    --->vamix.jar (run this to open VAMIX)
		    |
		    |
		    --->readme.txt
		    
4. Run vamix.jar through the command line with the command "java -jar vamix.jar" (you must navigate to the vamixfiles folder before doing so)	

Reasons for needing external jar files:
vlcj-3.0.1.jar is the external resource we used to play the videos without this we couldnt play the videos
jfxrt.jar is actual built in with java 1.7 however it is not loaded (it can be found in the java 1.7 SDK directory) this is used for gui design

	VAMIX Functionality

==================================

Menu bar
In Menu bar we can find file and state.
file is for loading files and state is for loading and saving state of vamix so user can use it next time.

Video Tab (Video editing)
In video tab user can load or download video/audio files, overlay text on videos, fade in/out videos and trim, crop and rotate videos.

Audio Tab (Audio editing)
In audio tab user can strip, replace or overlay audio for other audio or video files.

Render Tab (output video with text changes)
In the render tab the user can select one or both text scenes (title and credits) to render with the video. This process will output another video with the changes.

----------
  Strip
----------
In the strip function the user specifies an output path and when they click the strip audio button VAMIX will generate two files, an audio file and a video file with no audio.

----------
 Replace
----------
In the replace function the user specifies location of an audio file to use as replacement for the currently loaded video/audio. 
They then specify the time from the audio file and the time on the loaded file to replace. After the replace audio button is clicked, VAMIX will do the required processes and output a video
file with the changes.

----------
 Overlay
----------
In the overlay function the user specifies location of an audio file to use as the audio overlay for the currently loaded video/audio. 
They then specify the time from the audio file and the time on the loaded file to overlay on. After the overlay audio button is clicked, VAMIX will do the required processes and output a video
file with the changes.

---------
 Preview
---------
For preview there is two main type the audio tabs preview and text editing preview. In text editing, the preview is simply a picture of text. For audio editing preview, the preview is of the edited section. (5 seconds before the effect and 5 seconds after) this is done using avplay. Following is the command generated from avplay -help
While playing:
q, ESC              quit
f                   toggle full screen
p, SPC              pause
a                   cycle audio channel
v                   cycle video channel
t                   cycle subtitle channel
w                   show audio waves
s                   activate frame-step mode
left/right          seek backward/forward 10 seconds
down/up             seek backward/forward 1 minute
mouse click         seek to percentage in file corresponding to fraction of width

--------------
 Text Editing
--------------
In the text editing section of the video tab there are two inner tabs. One tab is for the title scene and the other is for the credits scene.
In each tab the user enters the text they want to show up for that scene, the font, font size and font colour.
The user also specifies the (x,y) coordinates for where the text should show up on the video.
Finally the start time (when the text will first show up) and the end time (when the text will disappear) for that certain scene are specified.
If the "XXX XXX Preview" buttons are clicked, VAMIX produces a preview snapshot of the start of the scene with text on it.
If the user is satisfied with how the text overlay looks they can go to the Render tab, see below for instructions.

--------------
 Fade In/Out
--------------
In the fade section of the video tab the user can choose to add a "fade in" effect and/or a "fade out" effect to the input video.
You need to specify the time to start the fade and the time to end the fade.
Select which fade types to include and click the fade button.
Output video file is generated at the location of the input file.

------
 Crop
------
In the crop section of the video tab the user specifies the (x,y) coordinates of where to start the cropping (left hand corner of "new video").
They then specify the new width and height. Once they click the crop button, after processes are completed the output video file will be generated at the location of the input file.

--------
 Rotate
--------
In the rotate section of the video tab the user specifies a clockwise angle that is either 90, 180 or 270 degrees.
They then click the rotate button and the output video file will be generated at the location of the input file.

-------
 Trim
-------
In the trim section of the video tab the user specifies the start time and end time of the output video file.
They then click the trim button and the output video file will be generated at the location of the input file.

-----------
 Rendering
-----------
In the Render tab the user selects an output destination for the rendered video file. If they select an existing output, VAMIX will ask them if they are sure they want to overwrite the file.
The user then checks which text scenes they want to render with the video, they can choose one or both. VAMIX will then display the progress of the render with the option to cancel.
